In early 2021 I decided to see if I could program a drone to dust off my TV. 

I couldn't... my house it too windy and the platform I chose (a DJI Tello drone) doesn't afford me low-level enough control to compensate for it. 

But I learned a lot about drones and re-ignited my latent passion for robotics, so it was still time well spent
