Despite the enthusiasm of my previous post I havn't posted in a while.

Initially this was due to laziness, but for at least the last few months this has been due to a technical issue -- I can't build the site to publish new content.

I still think a generated site is the right path forward, but I don't think Hugo was the right choice of generator for me. 

I've decided to look for a new static site generator, without having done any research yet, here's my wishlist:

* Converts markdown files into html with some degree of templating / sitemap generation
* Outputs plain HTML & CSS, should be no JS compatible, no server side rendering. 
* Implemented in a language I'm familiar with (feels like React should be a good fit?)
* Able to be built in a Github Action
* Some seperation between content and templates 
* Some sort of community behind it
