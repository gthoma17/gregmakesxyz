Self translation:

Hello (for the first time today)!

I'm Greg 👋. This is my journal for Japanese language study. I will write every week. I will do my best! 

＿＿

Questions I thought of while writing this journal:
* I wanted to say that this is my journal for Japanese practice, but I don't know how to say practice yet.
  * What is a reliable Japanese to English dictionary I can use to learn newe verbs?
* I wanted to combine the last two sentences, but I don't know how to say two verbs in one sentence yet.
* I wonder if I can find a list of simple journal prompts to write from, "just writing something" is harder than I'd expected!
