# Active Research Notes

## Need a Short-Term Place to Live Immediately 
Open Questions:
- Can one of the relocation folks help me find immediate housing?
  - Will the total cost be cheaper than looking on my own? (~100-200kå†† ðŸ˜¬)
- Will I be able to work from the office for the first few weeks?
- Will I be allowed to work from public co-working spaces? (Yahoo Lodge, AWS Forge)

Notes:
- tokyosharehouse.com is a search engine for share houses
- Sakura House seems pretty solid
- Maybe rent a normal 1K and just pay early termination fees if we need to?
  - Great search engine: https://apartments.gaijinpot.com/en/rent

### Options Comparison

# Research Notes That I'm done with

## Need a Japanese Cell Phone

Verdict: **Mobal**
I'll order a Mobal SIM card and have it shipped to Denver, that way I can swap my SIM during the flight and hit the ground running
I'll likely switch to a different provide after I've gotten a bit settled

- 3,300å††/mo for unlimited data
- 2,000å†† activation fee
- By far the best value for money.

- Need a bank account / Japanese Credit Card to pay

#### Sakura Mobile 
- 4,378å††/mo for 25Gb
- 5,500å†† activation fee
- Very good English support
- Offers airport sim card pickup
- Pay with USD or Yen

#### Mobal
- 4,378å††/mo for 25Gb
- 2,970å†† activation fee
- Very good English support

- Pay with PayPal, USD or Yen


## Port US Phone number in case I need it from Japan
