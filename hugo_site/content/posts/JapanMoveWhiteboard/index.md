### Find a short-term place to live immediately

 - Sakura House seems pretty solid
 - Maybe rent a normal 1K and just pay early termination fees if we need to?
   - Great search engine: https://apartments.gaijinpot.com/en/rent

##### Options Comparison
 
 - Hostel & Company Office or Coworking Space
   - I stay in a hostel or capsule share house and work out of some co-working space
   - Example Property: https://nakano.guest-house-tokyo.com/index_en.html
   - Cost: 
     - Monthly: 36,000å††
     - Move-In: 10,000å††
     - Refundable: 5,000å††  
     - Additional: 6,000å†† (showers and laundry)
   - Pros:
     - Most flexible option
     - Don't need to get furniture
   - Cons:
     - Probably the least comfortable option
     - 
   - Risks:
     - Might hate it and lose out on 5,000å††
     - Will I be allowed to pair on client projects from a co-working space?
 
 - Sharehouse
   - A private room with shared kitchen and bath facilities. For some reason the sharehouses in eastern Tokyo are cheaper
   - Example Property: https://www.tiger-house.com/bukken.php?b_id=13
   - Cost:
     - Monthly: 65,000å††
     - Move-In: 20,000å††
     - Refundable: 20,000å†† 
   - Pros:
     - Forced socialization with housemates ðŸ¤·
   - Cons:
     - Annecdotal reports that Sharehousemates can be awful
   - Risks:
     - Anecdotal reports that Sharehouse internet is unreliable
     - Some Sharehouses charge an additional office fee if you WFH

   - A furnished rental, basically corporate housing
   - Central Tokyo

       - Move-In: 238,290å††
       - Refundable: 0å††
       - â€ This is the cost for a 2 year lease, short term likely has higher costs
   - Outer Tokyo
