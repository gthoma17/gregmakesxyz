ðŸŽ‰ Notes now support optimized images! You can include pictures using Astro's Image component for better performance.

![Example Image demonstrating image support in notes](../../notes/images/example-image.svg)

Use Astro's optimized image processing by storing images in `/src/notes/images/` and referencing them with relative paths in markdown.

## Featured Images

You can also set a `featuredImage` in the frontmatter to display an image prominently at the top of your note:

```yaml
---
featuredImage: ../../notes/images/example-image.svg
---
```

The featured image should be stored in `/src/notes/images/` and referenced with a relative path from the note location.
