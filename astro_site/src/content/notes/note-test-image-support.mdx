ðŸŽ‰ Notes now support optimized images! You can include pictures using Astro's Image component for better performance.

![Example Image demonstrating image support in notes](../../assets/images/notes/example-image.svg)

Use Astro's optimized image processing by storing images in `/src/assets/images/notes/` and referencing them with relative paths in markdown.
