ðŸŽ‰ Notes now support optimized images! You can include pictures using Astro's Image component for better performance, including HEIC files from your iPhone.

![Example Image demonstrating image support in notes](../../notes/images/example-image.svg)

Use Astro's optimized image processing by storing images in `/src/notes/images/` and referencing them with relative paths in markdown.

## Featured Images

You can also set a `featuredImage` in the frontmatter to display an image prominently at the top of your note. Images from iPhone (including HEIC format) are fully supported:

```yaml
---
featuredImage: ./example-photo-iphone.jpg
---
```

The featured image should be stored in the same directory as your note content (e.g., `/src/content/notes/`) for content collection images, or use relative paths to images in `/src/notes/images/` for markdown content. 

**HEIC Support**: HEIC files from iPhone are supported through the underlying Sharp image processing library. For featured images in content collections, you may need to convert HEIC files to JPG/PNG format, but HEIC files work seamlessly in markdown content.
